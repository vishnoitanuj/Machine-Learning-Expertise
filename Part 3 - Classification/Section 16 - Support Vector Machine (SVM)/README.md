# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Maximum margin needs to be maintained from support vectors(which is the nearest unique point both sides of the decision boundary)

The line in the middle(seperating line) is called the <strong>Maximum Margin Hyperplane (maximum margin classifier)</strong>. In multi-dimensional plane space its a hyperplane.
The rest sides are called Negative hyperplanes and positive hyperplanes. The order does not matter

#### Note:
SVM uses extreme case to build a boundary. For eg. In case of classification of apples and oranges, it will look for oranges which are more likely like apple and vice versa.

Thus, it uses cases very close to the boundary called the support vectors and it uses that to construct its analysis.
