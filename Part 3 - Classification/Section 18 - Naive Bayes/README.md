# Bayes Theorem

P(A/B) = P(B/A) * P(A) / P(B)

### Why Naive
Because the data points are assumed to be independent. This is a naive way of going through things!! There might be some correlation, but that is neglected in case of this algorithm.

P(X): is a randombly selected oint from the dataset will exhibit the features similar to the datapoint we are about to add. (Hint: The circle drawn near new data point)
